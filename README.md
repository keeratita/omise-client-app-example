# Omise Tokenization Sample

Showcase for the usage of Omise Tokenization API to convert a card number to token to use for further charging or card saving

## Tokenization Sample
**1. Tokenize with Vanilla JavaScript**
For developers who works with generic website, Cordova, Ionic

**2. Tokenize with ReactJS**
For developers who works with ReactJS on Website. But this can also be applied with React Native.


## FAQ
#### What is a "tokenization"?**
Process of converting card number, security number, including other card information into a token (Ex. tokn_test_56pavx4vsrwplxpj72k). And you can later send the token to your server to charge or save it as card to charge later multiple times.

#### Why not [Omise.js](https://github.com/omise/omise.js)?
It works perfectly on the most browsers but it requires real HTML DOM to work with API, so it may not work with some mobile wrapper technologies like React Native.
